# Project 1

A look at how socioeconomic factors influence population growth

## Instructions

For Project 1, you will work with your group to find and analyze a dataset of your choice.

For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry.

-Project ideation

-Data fetching/API integration

-Data analysis

-Testing

-Creating documentation

-Creating the presentation

## Modules

pandas

A file called api_keys.py is required with a variable called geoapify_key that is assigned as your key from GeoApify.com. This file needs to be in the main repo as well as a copy inside the 'Cleaned_Datasets' folder.

## Summary

The repository includes datasets related to population growth, safety, poverty and education on a global scale. There are Jupyter Notebooks for cleaning and organizing each of the four initial datasets, which then saves the new data as a clean CSV to merge with the others.

The data cleaning included API calls to GeoApify to normalize syntax for merging and mapping.

The base_code_visualization notebook is the main analysis code that draws on each of the cleaned datasets, combines them and produces visualizations to compare the different socioeconomic factors to the growth rate across differing years (depending on each datatset).

The visualizations include hypothesis testing calculations such as correlation coefficient and p-value comparison.
